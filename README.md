# AI/ML Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal journey in learning and practicing concepts in Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning. It includes a collection of notebooks, mini-projects, tutorials, and experiments that I’ve worked on to
understand both foundational and advanced topics.

The structure is designed to be easy to follow for others who may also be starting out or revisiting concepts in AI/ML.
Contributions, feedback, and discussions are welcome.

## Repository Structure

**`notebooks/`**  
Jupyter notebooks covering a wide range of AI/ML topics such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and
more.

**`projects/`**  
End-to-end machine learning projects. Each project folder contains notebooks, data (or links to it), results, and notes.
These projects aim to apply learned concepts to real-world problems.

**`datasets/`**  
Sample datasets or instructions to download datasets used across notebooks and projects. This folder may also include
preprocessed versions of public datasets for quick access.

**`models/`**  
Contains saved model files and experiment outputs. This folder is helpful for tracking training progress, comparing
versions, and reusing trained models.

**`tutorials/`**  
Hands-on tutorials for specific tools or frameworks like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. These are smaller in
scope than full projects and are meant for focused practice.

**`utils/`**  
Helper scripts and utility functions used across notebooks and projects—for example, plotting functions, evaluation
metrics, and data transformation helpers.

## Progress Tracking

This repository will be updated regularly as I explore new topics, refine earlier work, and build new projects. Each
folder will include notes or a `README` where necessary to explain the context and purpose of the files within.

## Getting Started

If you're just browsing, start with the `notebooks/` folder. If you're looking for applications of ML concepts, check
out the `projects/` directory. For specific libraries or framework tutorials, head to the `tutorials/` section.

Don't forget to install all necessary packages:

```shell
pip install -r requirements-clean.txt
```

**Env**

* python 3.12
* macos
* pycharm

Make sure all the dirs are set as "Sources Root" in pycharm, I've added [setup.py](setup.py) which initialized this

```shell
models
notebooks
projects
tutorials
utils
```

Set the config: `cp config-example.py config.py`
Makesure you set the values accordingly
